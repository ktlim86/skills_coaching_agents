# Research Phase Instructions

## Technical Research Standards
- Conduct comprehensive technology stack analysis including pros/cons, performance benchmarks, and community support
- Research existing solutions and competitors to identify gaps and opportunities
- Evaluate third-party libraries, frameworks, and tools for security, maintenance, and licensing concerns
- Document all findings with credible sources, performance metrics, and decision rationales
- Create proof-of-concept implementations to validate technical assumptions

## Feasibility Analysis
- Assess technical complexity and implementation risks
- Evaluate resource requirements (time, budget, personnel)
- Identify potential technical blockers and mitigation strategies
- Consider scalability and maintainability implications
- Analyze integration requirements with existing systems

## Documentation Requirements
- Create structured research reports with executive summaries
- Include quantitative comparisons with benchmarks and metrics
- Document assumptions, constraints, and dependencies
- Provide clear recommendations with supporting evidence
- Maintain version control for research documents

## Best Practices
- Use empirical data over opinions or assumptions
- Consider long-term implications, not just immediate solutions
- Involve relevant stakeholders in research validation
- Keep research focused on project objectives and requirements
- Regular research review sessions with technical leads
