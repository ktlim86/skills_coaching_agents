## Story Information
- **Story ID**: US-2025-006A
- **Title**: Agent Architecture Design and Foundation
- **Description**: Design the multi-agent system architecture and create base agent interfaces for the three-agent learning platform
- **Status**: Done
- **Created Date**: 2025-09-14 13:42:44 SGT
- **Start Date**: 2025-09-14 15:37:05 SGT

- **Duration**: 2 minutes 18 seconds

## User Story
**As a** system architect
**I want** to design the multi-agent system architecture and create base agent interfaces
**So that** I have a solid foundation for implementing the three specialized agents

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** the need for a three-agent system (Skill Coach, Skill Assessor, Course Matcher)
**When** I design the architecture
**Then** I should have clear agent interfaces and communication patterns defined

**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agent architecture documentation created
- Base agent interface/class designed
- Agent responsibility separation clearly defined
- Communication patterns between agents documented
- Agent lifecycle management approach defined
- Foundation ready for specific agent implementations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Agent architecture document created
- [ ] Base agent interface/abstract class implemented
- [ ] Agent responsibility matrix documented
- [ ] Communication patterns designed and documented
- [ ] Agent lifecycle management approach defined
- [ ] Foundation code structure created
- [ ] Architecture reviewed and approved
- [ ] Ready for individual agent implementations

## Status Workflow & Approval Gates
1. **Not Started** → Story created with date command timestamp
2. **PO Approved** → Product Owner approval required before development
3. **In Progress** → Development started, Start Date populated with date command
4. **PO Acceptance** → Development complete, awaiting PO sign-off
5. **Done** → PO accepted, End Date and Duration calculated

### Gated Process Rules
- ❌ **Cannot move to "In Progress" without "PO Approved" status**
- ❌ **Cannot move to "Done" without "PO Acceptance" status**
- ✅ **All date fields automatically populated using `date` command**
- ✅ **Duration automatically calculated when status = "Done"**

## Technical Implementation
- Create agent architecture documentation
- Design base agent interface/abstract class
- Define agent communication protocols
- Create agent factory pattern foundation
- Document agent lifecycle management

## Story Points
- **T-Shirt Size**: S
- **Fibonacci Points**: 3
- **Complexity**: Medium (design and documentation focus)

## Dependencies
- US-2025-003 (Data Analysis and Course Mapping) should be completed first

## Notes
This story focuses purely on design and foundation - no complex implementation logic.
