## Story Information
- **Story ID**: US-2025-006B
- **Title**: Skill Coach Agent Implementation
- **Description**: Implement the Skill Coach Agent that serves as the main coordinator for user interactions and orchestrates other agents
- **Status**: Done
- **Created Date**: 2025-09-14 13:42:44 SGT
- **Start Date**: 2025-09-14 15:39:23 SGT

- **Duration**: 6 minutes 8 seconds

## User Story
**As a** learner
**I want** to interact with a Skill Coach Agent that coordinates my learning journey
**So that** I have a central point of contact that manages my skill assessment and course recommendation process

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** the agent architecture foundation is complete
**When** I interact with the learning platform
**Then** the Skill Coach Agent should coordinate my interactions and orchestrate other agents

**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**
- Skill Coach Agent class implemented extending base agent
- Main user interaction coordinator functionality
- Agent orchestration capabilities for calling other agents
- Conversation flow management
- User session state management
- Integration points for Skill Assessor and Course Matcher agents

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Skill Coach Agent class implemented
- [ ] User interaction coordination logic
- [ ] Agent orchestration methods created
- [ ] Conversation flow state management
- [ ] Integration interfaces for other agents
- [ ] User session management
- [ ] Basic conversation capabilities
- [ ] Unit tests for agent functionality

## Status Workflow & Approval Gates
1. **Not Started** → Story created with date command timestamp
2. **PO Approved** → Product Owner approval required before development
3. **In Progress** → Development started, Start Date populated with date command
4. **PO Acceptance** → Development complete, awaiting PO sign-off
5. **Done** → PO accepted, End Date and Duration calculated

### Gated Process Rules
- ❌ **Cannot move to "In Progress" without "PO Approved" status**
- ❌ **Cannot move to "Done" without "PO Acceptance" status**
- ✅ **All date fields automatically populated using `date` command**
- ✅ **Duration automatically calculated when status = "Done"**

## Technical Implementation
- Implement SkillCoachAgent class extending base agent
- Create user interaction methods
- Implement agent coordination logic
- Add conversation state management
- Create integration points for other agents

## Story Points
- **T-Shirt Size**: S
- **Fibonacci Points**: 5
- **Complexity**: Medium (agent implementation, coordination logic)

## Dependencies
- US-2025-006A (Agent Architecture Design) must be completed first

## Agent Responsibilities
- Main user interaction coordinator
- Orchestrates Skill Assessor and Course Matcher agents
- Manages conversation flow and user session state
- Provides final recommendations to user
- Handles user queries and learning journey guidance
