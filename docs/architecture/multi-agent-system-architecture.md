# Multi-Agent Learning Platform Architecture

## Overview
This document defines the architecture for the multi-agent learning platform consisting of three specialized agents working together to provide personalized learning recommendations.

## Agent Architecture Design

### Core Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has distinct responsibilities
2. **Loose Coupling**: Agents communicate through well-defined interfaces
3. **Extensibility**: Architecture supports adding new agents
4. **State Management**: Centralized conversation and user state
5. **Event-Driven**: Agents communicate via events and messages

## Agent Ecosystem

### 1. Skill Coach Agent (Primary Coordinator)
**Role**: Main user interface and orchestration
**Responsibilities**:
- Primary user interaction point
- Conversation flow management
- User session state management
- Agent orchestration and coordination
- Learning journey guidance

**Communication Pattern**: Hub pattern - coordinates with other agents

### 2. Skill Assessor Agent (Assessment Specialist)
**Role**: Skill evaluation and gap analysis
**Responsibilities**:
- Process assessment quiz results
- Calculate competency and capability scores
- Determine skill quadrant placement
- Identify skill gaps and weaknesses
- Generate assessment reports

**Communication Pattern**: Responds to assessment requests from Skill Coach

### 3. Course Matcher Agent (Recommendation Engine)
**Role**: Course matching and recommendations
**Responsibilities**:
- Match courses to skill gaps
- Generate personalized course recommendations
- Create learning paths based on skill levels
- Prioritize courses by difficulty and prerequisites
- Track course completion and progress

**Communication Pattern**: Responds to recommendation requests with user profile

## Technical Architecture

### Base Agent Interface
```typescript
interface IAgent {
  name: string;
  type: AgentType;
  processRequest(request: AgentRequest): Promise<AgentResponse>;
  getCapabilities(): AgentCapability[];
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  cleanup(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Agent Communication Protocol
- **Request/Response Pattern**: Synchronous communication for immediate responses
- **Event Broadcasting**: Asynchronous communication for state updates
- **Message Serialization**: JSON-based message format
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error response format

### State Management
- **User Session**: Centralized user state and conversation history
- **Agent State**: Individual agent internal state management
- **Shared Context**: Cross-agent data sharing mechanism
- **Persistence**: Session and progress persistence strategy

### Agent Lifecycle
1. **Initialization**: Agent setup and capability registration
2. **Active**: Processing requests and generating responses
3. **Idle**: Waiting for requests, maintaining state
4. **Cleanup**: Resource cleanup and state persistence

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (006A)
- Base agent interface design
- Communication protocol definition
- State management architecture
- Agent factory pattern

### Phase 2: Core Agents (006B, 006C)
- Skill Coach Agent implementation
- Skill Assessor Agent implementation
- Agent integration and testing

### Phase 3: Extensions (Future)
- Course Matcher Agent enhancements
- Additional specialized agents
- Advanced orchestration patterns

## Security and Error Handling

### Security Considerations
- Input validation for all agent requests
- Sanitization of user-generated content
- Rate limiting for agent interactions
- Secure state storage and transmission

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when agents fail
- Fallback responses for critical operations
- Error logging and monitoring
- User-friendly error messages

## Performance and Scalability

### Performance Optimizations
- Agent response caching
- Lazy loading of agent capabilities
- Parallel agent processing where possible
- Efficient state serialization

### Scalability Considerations
- Stateless agent design where possible
- Horizontal scaling through agent distribution
- Load balancing for agent requests
- Resource pooling and management

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Agent response times
- Request/response volumes
- Error rates and types
- User satisfaction metrics

### Logging Strategy
- Structured logging format
- Agent interaction tracing
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting

This architecture provides a solid foundation for implementing the three-agent learning platform with clear separation of concerns and robust communication patterns.
