## User Story
**As a** learner
**I want** to interact with an agentic AI chat system that helps me discover skill gaps
**So that** I can get personalized learning recommendations and course planning

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I access the learning platform
**When** I start a chat session
**Then** the interface should split into left chat panel and right results panel

**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**
- Chat interface moves to left side when conversation starts
- Right panel displays dynamic content (assessments, results, recommendations)
- AI greeting message welcomes users and offers skill learning assistance
- Interface is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- Foundation ready for multi-agent integration
- Clean separation between chat and results display areas

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Split-screen interface implemented (left chat, right results panel)
- [ ] Chat interface properly repositioned on conversation start
- [ ] Right panel ready for dynamic content display
- [ ] AI greeting and initial conversation flow
- [ ] Responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] Foundation architecture for multi-agent system
- [ ] Code implemented and peer reviewed
- [ ] UI/UX tested for usability

## Status Workflow & Approval Gates
1. **Not Started** → Story created with date command timestamp
2. **PO Approved** → Product Owner approval required before development
3. **In Progress** → Development started, Start Date populated with date command
4. **PO Acceptance** → Development complete, awaiting PO sign-off
5. **Done** → PO accepted, End Date and Duration calculated

### Gated Process Rules
- ❌ **Cannot move to "In Progress" without "PO Approved" status**
- ❌ **Cannot move to "Done" without "PO Acceptance" status**
- ✅ **All date fields automatically populated using `date` command**
- ✅ **Duration automatically calculated when status = "Done"**

## Technical Implementation
- Modify existing ChatInterface component for split-screen layout
- Create right panel component for dynamic content display
- Implement responsive CSS Grid or Flexbox layout
- Add state management for panel visibility and content
- Prepare architecture for multi-agent system integration

## Story Points
- **T-Shirt Size**: M
- **Fibonacci Points**: 8
- **Complexity**: High (UI restructure, responsive design, architecture foundation)

## Dependencies
- US-2025-002 (Basic Chat Interface Component) - Completed
- US-2025-003 (Data Analysis and Course Mapping) must be completed first

## Notes
This story focuses on the UI foundation and LinkedIn Learning-inspired interface described in backlog02.md slides 4-7.
