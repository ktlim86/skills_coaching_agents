# Story Card

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: US-2025-006
- **Title**: Multi-Agent System Architecture Foundation
- **Description**: Implement the foundation for a three-agent system (Skill Coach, Skill Assessor, Course Matcher) with proper agent communication and coordination
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Created Date**: 2025-09-14 13:37:59 SGT
- **Start Date**: [Auto-populated when status changes to "In Progress"]
- **End Date**: [Auto-populated when status changes to "Done"]
- **Duration**: [Auto-calculated when status is "Done": End Date - Start Date]

## User Story
**As a** system architect
**I want** to implement a multi-agent system foundation
**So that** different AI agents can collaborate to provide comprehensive learning recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** the system needs to process skill assessments and recommend courses
**When** a user completes an assessment
**Then** multiple agents should work together to analyze skills and provide recommendations

**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**
- Skill Coach Agent: Main coordinator for user interactions
- Skill Assessor Agent: Processes assessment results and identifies skill gaps
- Course Matcher Agent: Matches skills to courses from database/CSV
- Agent communication protocol established
- Clear separation of responsibilities between agents
- Foundation for agent coordination and data flow

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Agent architecture design documented
- [ ] Skill Coach Agent foundation implemented
- [ ] Skill Assessor Agent foundation implemented  
- [ ] Course Matcher Agent foundation implemented
- [ ] Inter-agent communication mechanism
- [ ] Agent responsibility separation established
- [ ] Basic agent coordination workflow
- [ ] Foundation ready for specific agent logic implementation

## Status Workflow & Approval Gates
1. **Not Started** → Story created with date command timestamp
2. **PO Approved** → Product Owner approval required before development
3. **In Progress** → Development started, Start Date populated with date command
4. **PO Acceptance** → Development complete, awaiting PO sign-off
5. **Done** → PO accepted, End Date and Duration calculated

### Gated Process Rules
- ❌ **Cannot move to "In Progress" without "PO Approved" status**
- ❌ **Cannot move to "Done" without "PO Acceptance" status**
- ✅ **All date fields automatically populated using `date` command**
- ✅ **Duration automatically calculated when status = "Done"**

## Technical Implementation
- Design agent architecture and communication patterns
- Create base agent classes/interfaces
- Implement agent factory and coordination mechanisms
- Establish data flow between agents
- Prepare for CSV data integration

## Story Points
- **T-Shirt Size**: L (needs breakdown)
- **Fibonacci Points**: 13 (MUST BREAK DOWN)
- **Complexity**: Very High (architecture, multi-agent coordination)

## Dependencies
- US-2025-003 (Data Analysis and Course Mapping) must be completed first
- US-2025-005 (Skill Assessment Quiz) should be completed first

## Notes
**ATTENTION**: This story is 13 points and MUST BE BROKEN DOWN into smaller stories (≤8 points each) before development can begin. Consider creating separate stories for:
1. Agent architecture design (3 points)
2. Individual agent foundations (3 points each)
3. Inter-agent communication (5 points)

## Agent Responsibilities
**Skill Coach Agent:**
- Main user interaction coordinator
- Orchestrates other agents
- Provides final recommendations to user

**Skill Assessor Agent:**
- Processes quiz results
- Calculates competency/capability scores
- Identifies skill gaps and quadrant placement

**Course Matcher Agent:**
- Accesses course database/CSV
- Matches skills to appropriate courses
- Orders courses by learning progression
