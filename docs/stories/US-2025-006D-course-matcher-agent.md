# Story Card

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: US-2025-006D
- **Title**: Course Matcher Agent Implementation
- **Description**: Implement the Course Matcher Agent that accesses course data and matches skills to appropriate courses with learning progression ordering
- **Status**: Done
- **Created Date**: 2025-09-14 13:42:44 SGT
- **Start Date**: 2025-09-14 15:50:12 SGT
- **End Date**: 2025-09-14 18:09:28 SGT
- **Duration**: 2 hours 19 minutes 16 seconds

## User Story
**As a** learner
**I want** the Course Matcher Agent to find relevant courses for my skill gaps
**So that** I can receive appropriate course recommendations ordered by learning progression

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have skill gaps identified by the Skill Assessor Agent
**When** the Course Matcher Agent processes my skill needs
**Then** I should receive relevant course recommendations ordered by progression level

**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**
- Course Matcher Agent class implemented extending base agent
- CSV course data access and querying
- Skill-to-course matching algorithm
- Course progression ordering (foundational → intermediate → advanced)
- Integration with course mapping data from US-2025-003
- Course recommendation ranking based on relevance

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Course Matcher Agent class implemented
- [ ] CSV course data access methods
- [ ] Skill-to-course matching algorithm
- [ ] Course progression ordering logic
- [ ] Course recommendation ranking system
- [ ] Integration with course mapping CSV data
- [ ] Query optimization for course searches
- [ ] Unit tests for matching algorithms

## Status Workflow & Approval Gates
1. **Not Started** → Story created with date command timestamp
2. **PO Approved** → Product Owner approval required before development
3. **In Progress** → Development started, Start Date populated with date command
4. **PO Acceptance** → Development complete, awaiting PO sign-off
5. **Done** → PO accepted, End Date and Duration calculated

### Gated Process Rules
- ❌ **Cannot move to "In Progress" without "PO Approved" status**
- ❌ **Cannot move to "Done" without "PO Acceptance" status**
- ✅ **All date fields automatically populated using `date` command**
- ✅ **Duration automatically calculated when status = "Done"**

## Technical Implementation
- Implement CourseMatcherAgent class extending base agent
- Create CSV data access and parsing methods
- Implement skill-to-course matching algorithms
- Add course progression ordering logic
- Create course recommendation ranking system

## Story Points
- **T-Shirt Size**: S
- **Fibonacci Points**: 5
- **Complexity**: Medium (data access, matching algorithms)

## Dependencies
- US-2025-006A (Agent Architecture Design) must be completed first
- US-2025-003 (Data Analysis and Course Mapping) must be completed first

## Matching Logic
- Access course mapping CSV created in US-2025-003
- Match identified skill gaps to available courses
- Order courses by learning progression (foundational first)
- Consider learner's current quadrant for recommendation prioritization
- Provide clear rationale for each course recommendation
