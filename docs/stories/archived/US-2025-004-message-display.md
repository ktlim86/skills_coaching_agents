# Story Card

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: US-2025-004
- **Title**: Message Display and Storage
- **Description**: Display sent messages in the chat area and store them temporarily in browser memory for the session
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Created Date**: 2025-09-10 09:05:08 SGT
- **Start Date**: [Auto-populated when status changes to "In Progress"]
- **End Date**: [Auto-populated when status changes to "Done"]
- **Duration**: [Auto-calculated when status is "Done": End Date - Start Date]

## User Story
**As a** user
**I want** to see my sent messages appear in the chat display area
**So that** I can have a basic conversation experience and see message history

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have sent a message using the input field
**When** the send action completes
**Then** my message should appear in the chat display area

**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**
- Messages display in chronological order (newest at bottom)
- Each message shows the text content clearly
- Messages persist during the browser session
- Chat area scrolls to show the latest message
- Basic message styling for readability
- Multiple messages can be displayed in sequence

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Messages display in the chat area after sending
- [ ] Messages are stored in browser memory (React state)
- [ ] Messages display in correct chronological order
- [ ] Chat area auto-scrolls to latest message
- [ ] Basic styling applied to messages
- [ ] Multiple messages can be sent and displayed
- [ ] Code implemented and peer reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written with >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for message flow

## Status Workflow & Approval Gates
1. **Not Started** → Story created with date command timestamp
2. **PO Approved** → Product Owner approval required before development
3. **In Progress** → Development started, Start Date populated with date command
4. **PO Acceptance** → Development complete, awaiting PO sign-off
5. **Done** → PO accepted, End Date and Duration calculated

### Gated Process Rules
- ❌ **Cannot move to "In Progress" without "PO Approved" status**
- ❌ **Cannot move to "Done" without "PO Acceptance" status**
- ✅ **All date fields automatically populated using `date` command**
- ✅ **Duration automatically calculated when status = "Done"**

## Technical Notes
- Use React state (useState) to store messages array
- Implement message display component/logic
- Add auto-scroll functionality to chat container
- Basic message styling with CSS
- No server-side storage - client-side only for MVP

## Story Points
- **T-Shirt Size**: S
- **Fibonacci Points**: 3
- **Complexity**: Medium (state management and display logic)

## Dependencies
- US-2025-003 (Message Input and Send Functionality) must be completed first

## MVP Scope
- Client-side storage only (messages lost on refresh)
- No user identification (all messages appear as from same user)
- Basic text messages only
- No timestamps or advanced features
