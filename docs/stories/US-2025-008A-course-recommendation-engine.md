# Story Card

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: US-2025-008A
- **Title**: Course Recommendation Engine
- **Description**: Implement the course recommendation algorithm that generates personalized course suggestions based on skill gap analysis results
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Created Date**: 2025-09-14 13:42:44 SGT
- **Start Date**: [Auto-populated when status changes to "In Progress"]
- **End Date**: [Auto-populated when status changes to "Done"]
- **Duration**: [Auto-calculated when status is "Done": End Date - Start Date]

## User Story
**As a** learner
**I want** to receive personalized course recommendations based on my skill assessment
**So that** I can identify the most relevant courses to improve my skills

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have completed skill assessment and received quadrant analysis
**When** the recommendation engine processes my results
**Then** I should see personalized course suggestions ordered by learning progression

**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**
- Course recommendation algorithm implemented
- Integration with skill gap analysis from Skill Assessor Agent
- Course progression ordering (foundational → intermediate → advanced)
- Recommendation relevance scoring based on skill gaps
- Integration with course data from Course Matcher Agent
- Clear rationale provided for each recommendation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Course recommendation algorithm implemented
- [ ] Integration with Skill Assessor Agent results
- [ ] Course progression ordering logic
- [ ] Recommendation relevance scoring system
- [ ] Integration with Course Matcher Agent
- [ ] Recommendation rationale generation
- [ ] Algorithm performance optimization
- [ ] Unit tests for recommendation logic

## Status Workflow & Approval Gates
1. **Not Started** → Story created with date command timestamp
2. **PO Approved** → Product Owner approval required before development
3. **In Progress** → Development started, Start Date populated with date command
4. **PO Acceptance** → Development complete, awaiting PO sign-off
5. **Done** → PO accepted, End Date and Duration calculated

### Gated Process Rules
- ❌ **Cannot move to "In Progress" without "PO Approved" status**
- ❌ **Cannot move to "Done" without "PO Acceptance" status**
- ✅ **All date fields automatically populated using `date` command**
- ✅ **Duration automatically calculated when status = "Done"**

## Technical Implementation
- Implement recommendation algorithm based on skill gaps
- Create course relevance scoring system
- Add progression ordering logic
- Integrate with agent system for data flow
- Optimize algorithm performance

## Story Points
- **T-Shirt Size**: M
- **Fibonacci Points**: 5
- **Complexity**: Medium (algorithm implementation, integration)

## Dependencies
- US-2025-007 (Skill Gap Analysis and Quadrant Visualization) must be completed first
- US-2025-006C (Skill Assessor Agent) must be completed first
- US-2025-006D (Course Matcher Agent) must be completed first

## Recommendation Logic
- Analyze skill gaps from assessment results
- Match gaps to available courses using Course Matcher Agent
- Order courses by learning progression (foundational first)
- Consider learner's current quadrant for prioritization
- Generate clear rationale for each recommendation
