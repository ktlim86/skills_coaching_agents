## User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** a properly configured Next.js project with Node.js backend
**So that** I can build the chat functionality on a solid technical foundation

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** the project requirements for a chat website
**When** I set up the development environment
**Then** I should have a running Next.js application with basic routing

**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**
- Next.js 14+ with App Router is installed and configured
- Node.js 18+ environment is set up
- Basic project structure is created (pages, components, styles folders)
- Development server runs without errors
- Basic homepage route is accessible

## Definition of Done
- [x] Next.js project created with latest stable version (v15.5.2)
- [x] Development server starts and runs without errors (http://localhost:3000)
- [x] Basic project structure is in place (src/app/ with App Router)
- [x] Package.json configured with necessary dependencies
- [x] Basic homepage component renders successfully
- [x] Code implemented following project standards (TypeScript, ESLint)
- [x] Documentation updated with setup instructions (SETUP.md created)

## Status Workflow & Approval Gates
1. **Not Started** → Story created with date command timestamp
2. **PO Approved** → Product Owner approval required before development
3. **In Progress** → Development started, Start Date populated with date command
4. **PO Acceptance** → Development complete, awaiting PO sign-off
5. **Done** → PO accepted, End Date and Duration calculated

### Gated Process Rules
- ❌ **Cannot move to "In Progress" without "PO Approved" status**
- ❌ **Cannot move to "Done" without "PO Acceptance" status**
- ✅ **All date fields automatically populated using `date` command**
- ✅ **Duration automatically calculated when status = "Done"**

## Technical Notes
- Use Next.js App Router (not Pages Router)
- Include TypeScript for better development experience
- Set up basic ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Use standard Node.js version (18+)

## Story Points
- **T-Shirt Size**: XS
- **Fibonacci Points**: 2
- **Complexity**: Low (well-established setup process)
