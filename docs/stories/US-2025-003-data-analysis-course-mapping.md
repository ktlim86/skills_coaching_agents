# Story Card

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: US-2025-003
- **Title**: Data Analysis and Course Mapping Foundation
- **Description**: Analyze existing CSV data files to understand job roles and skills mapping, then create a comprehensive course content mapping CSV for testing data
- **Status**: PO Accepted ✅
- **Created Date**: 2025-09-14 13:37:59 SGT
- **PO Approval Date**: 2025-09-14 13:47:38 SGT
- **Start Date**: 2025-09-14 13:48:28 SGT
- **End Date**: 2025-09-14 14:14:03 SGT
- **PO Acceptance Date**: 2025-09-14 14:19:53 SGT
- **Duration**: 25 minutes 35 seconds

## User Story
**As a** system architect
**I want** to analyze the job roles and skills data from CSV files and create a course mapping dataset
**So that** I can provide testing data for the agentic AI learning platform

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have access to jobsandskills-skillsfuture-tsc-to-unique-skills-mapping.csv and job_role_tcs_ccs.csv
**When** I analyze the data structure and relationships
**Then** I should create a comprehensive course content mapping CSV

**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**
- Analyze the structure of both CSV files to understand data relationships
- Map job roles to required skills based on the data
- Generate realistic course content that aligns with job roles and skills
- Create output CSV with columns: job_role, skill_required, course_title, course_level, proficiency_target
- Ensure course progression logic (foundational → intermediate → advanced)
- Include at least 50 course mappings for testing purposes
- Validate data quality and completeness

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CSV data analysis completed with documented findings
- [ ] Job role to skill mapping identified and documented
- [ ] Course content generation logic implemented
- [ ] Output CSV file created with proper structure
- [ ] Data validation performed on output
- [ ] Documentation provided for data relationships
- [ ] Code implemented and peer reviewed
- [ ] Testing data ready for prototype development

## Status Workflow & Approval Gates
1. **Not Started** → Story created with date command timestamp
2. **PO Approved** → Product Owner approval required before development
3. **In Progress** → Development started, Start Date populated with date command
4. **PO Acceptance** → Development complete, awaiting PO sign-off
5. **Done** → PO accepted, End Date and Duration calculated

### Gated Process Rules
- ❌ **Cannot move to "In Progress" without "PO Approved" status**
- ❌ **Cannot move to "Done" without "PO Acceptance" status**
- ✅ **All date fields automatically populated using `date` command**
- ✅ **Duration automatically calculated when status = "Done"**

## Technical Implementation
- Use Python/pandas for CSV data analysis
- Create data mapping algorithms for job role to skill relationships
- Generate course content based on skill requirements and proficiency levels
- Output structured CSV for use in subsequent development phases
- Document data lineage and transformation logic

## Story Points
- **T-Shirt Size**: M
- **Fibonacci Points**: 8
- **Complexity**: High (data analysis, mapping logic, content generation)

## Dependencies
- Access to existing CSV files in docs/backlog/
- No other story dependencies (this is the foundation story)

## Notes
This is the prerequisite task mentioned in backlog02.md that must be completed before proceeding with other development work.
