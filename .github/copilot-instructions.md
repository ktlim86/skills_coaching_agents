# Software Development Lifecycle Instructions Reference

## Pre-Development Phase
- **[instructions/research.instructions.md](./instructions/research.instructions.md)**: Technical research, feasibility analysis, technology stack evaluation, and competitive analysis
- **[instructions/user-stories.instructions.md](./instructions/user-stories.instructions.md)**: User story templates, acceptance criteria, approval workflows, and requirement documentation
- **[instructions/backlog.instructions.md](./instructions/backlog.instructions.md)**: Story breakdown, Fibonacci estimation, MVP principles, spike management, and uncertainty resolution

## Design & Planning Phase
- **[instructions/design.instructions.md](./instructions/design.instructions.md)**: System architecture, API design, data architecture, security by design, and design documentation standards

## Implementation & Validation Phase
- **[instructions/prototype.instructions.md](./instructions/prototype.instructions.md)**: MVP development for user experience validation and rapid iteration
- **[instructions/code-development.instructions.md](./instructions/code-development.instructions.md)**: Production code guidelines, SOLID principles, testing requirements, security implementation, and code review standards
- **[instructions/testing.instructions.md](./instructions/testing.instructions.md)**: Comprehensive testing strategy, unit/integration/E2E testing, production-like environments, and test evidence documentation

## Deployment & Operations Phase
- **[instructions/architecture-infrastructure.instructions.md](./instructions/architecture-infrastructure.instructions.md)**: Infrastructure as Code, containerization, cloud architecture, security architecture, and DevOps practices
- **[instructions/sre.instructions.md](./instructions/sre.instructions.md)**: Site Reliability Engineering, monitoring, incident response, capacity planning, and operational excellence

## Key Relationships
- **Spike (POC)** vs **Prototype (MVP)**: Technical feasibility vs user value validation
- **Design** â†’ **Code Development**: Architecture specifications guide implementation
- **Testing** integrates across all phases with production-like validation
- **All phases** follow universal engineering principles defined above
