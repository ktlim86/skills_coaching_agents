# Story Card

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: US-2025-006C
- **Title**: Skill Assessor Agent Implementation
- **Description**: Implement the Skill Assessor Agent that processes quiz results, calculates competency/capability scores, and identifies skill gaps
- **Status**: Done
- **Created Date**: 2025-09-14 13:42:44 SGT
- **Start Date**: 2025-09-14 15:39:23 SGT
- **End Date**: 2025-09-14 15:45:31 SGT
- **Duration**: 6 minutes 8 seconds

## User Story
**As a** learner
**I want** the Skill Assessor Agent to analyze my quiz results
**So that** I can understand my competency and capability levels and identify skill gaps

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I have completed a skill assessment quiz
**When** the Skill Assessor Agent processes my results
**Then** I should receive competency/capability scores and skill gap analysis

**Additional Acceptance Criteria:**
- Skill Assessor Agent class implemented extending base agent
- Quiz result processing logic
- Competency score calculation (average of 5 questions)
- Capability score calculation (average of 5 questions)
- Quadrant determination logic
- Skill gap identification based on assessment results

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Skill Assessor Agent class implemented
- [ ] Quiz result processing methods
- [ ] Competency score calculation algorithm
- [ ] Capability score calculation algorithm
- [ ] Quadrant determination logic (4 quadrants)
- [ ] Skill gap analysis functionality
- [ ] Integration with assessment quiz data
- [ ] Unit tests for calculation logic

## Status Workflow & Approval Gates
1. **Not Started** → Story created with date command timestamp
2. **PO Approved** → Product Owner approval required before development
3. **In Progress** → Development started, Start Date populated with date command
4. **PO Acceptance** → Development complete, awaiting PO sign-off
5. **Done** → PO accepted, End Date and Duration calculated

### Gated Process Rules
- ❌ **Cannot move to "In Progress" without "PO Approved" status**
- ❌ **Cannot move to "Done" without "PO Acceptance" status**
- ✅ **All date fields automatically populated using `date` command**
- ✅ **Duration automatically calculated when status = "Done"**

## Technical Implementation
- Implement SkillAssessorAgent class extending base agent
- Create quiz result processing methods
- Implement scoring algorithms for competency and capability
- Add quadrant determination logic
- Create skill gap analysis methods

## Story Points
- **T-Shirt Size**: S
- **Fibonacci Points**: 5
- **Complexity**: Medium (calculations, logic implementation)

## Dependencies
- US-2025-006A (Agent Architecture Design) must be completed first
- US-2025-005 (Skill Assessment Quiz) should be completed first

## Calculation Logic
**Competency Score**: Average of questions 1-5 (0-3 scale)
**Capability Score**: Average of questions 6-10 (0-3 scale)

**Quadrant Mapping**:
- Expert Practitioner: High Competency (≥2), High Capability (≥2)
- Natural Doer: Low Competency (<2), High Capability (≥2)
- Emerging Talent: Low Competency (<2), Low Capability (<2)
- Theorist: High Competency (≥2), Low Capability (<2)
